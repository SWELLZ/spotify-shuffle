# Spotify Shuffle

## Problem
I've always been a big hater of spotify's built in shuffle feature so I never use it. I normally shuffle my playlist by using Random.org and randomizing my playlist there, then copying and pasting it back into spotify. That takes up too much time and it's not possible to do on a mobile device so I'm making this site to achieve that. It will use the Spotify API to seamlessly rearrange the playlist on any device.

## Technology Used
- ReactJS
- React Router
- TailwindCSS
- Spotify API

## Contributions
Feel free to contribute to this project if you see in open issue or if you'd like to help with refactoring and documentation. I am also open to suggestions on the direction of this project, feel free to join or start a discussion on what should be added. You don't need to ask to contribute, if you see an open issue or you see room for improvement, just follow these steps:

### Fork the repo
Click the fork botton on the top of this page to create a copy of this repository.

Now you need to clone the repo onto your local machine. Go to your GitHub account, open the newly forked repo, click the code button and then click *copy to clipboard*.

Open your terminal and run this command:

```
### Create a branch
Create a branch off of the working branch or master branch depending on what's needed using the `git switch` command:
```
git switch -c your-branch-name
```
If I am working out of a branch that isn't the main branch, create a branch off of that one using this command:
```
git switch -c your-branch-name working-branch
```
### Make your changes
Now you just need to make the necessary changes in that branch. When done just commit and push those changes. Make sure you install the dependencies by running:
